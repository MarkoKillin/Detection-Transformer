# Detection Transformer (DETR)

This project was developed as part of a university deep learning course. The implementation and training were done entirely in Google Colab, so the repository contains a single, well-documented notebook.
The main goal of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the DETR architecture and demonstrate that it can successfully learn even on relatively small datasets. The focus was on exploration and learning rather than achieving state-of-the-art results.
